# Girlfriend-present-android-app
Android Studio project made as a present to my girlfriend and used to learn Android Studio, android development, MVVM, and Jetpack Compose.

## Making it work
Without changing anything, phrases won't be displayed and galleries will be empty. To make them work:
- Add phrases to assets/json/phrases.json file, to see phrases displayed in Phrases' window.
- Add pictures under each subfolder on assets/images/galleries, to see photos displayed for each gallery. Also make sure to add each file's to it's corresponding category array on photos.json.

Feel free to try it out!
